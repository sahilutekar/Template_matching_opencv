Template Matching with OpenCV
Template matching is a powerful image processing technique that allows us to find a sub-image (template) within a larger image. It has applications in various fields, including computer vision, object detection, and image recognition. In this blog post, we'll explore how to perform template matching using the OpenCV library in Python.
Getting Started

Before we dive into the code, let's understand the basic concept of template matching. The idea is to slide the template over the input image and calculate a similarity measure at each position. OpenCV provides a function called cv2.matchTemplate for this purpose. The result is a grayscale image where each pixel represents the correlation between the template and the corresponding region in the input image.
